# Locust.NET
Locust.NET is a multi-purpose package currently containing 113 libraries.

It is in essence a layer over FCL (.NET class libraries) but is a layer below .NET projects.

It can be used in various projects, mostly ASP.NET projects.

In the near future I will create nuget packages for that too.
